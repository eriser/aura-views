Aura is a rendering framework for HTML Canvas. It is modeled on the Chromium "views" UI toolkit, which is itself modeled on frameworks like Swing and Cocoa.

Aura provides a set of JavaScript classes that can be subclassed to render UI and respond to events within it. Aura's event propagation is distinct, identical to Chromium views' and not based on DOM events.

Aura provides a Widget class that wraps a canvas tag and a View class that allows for the construction of UI elements within that Widget.

  * unit testing
  * ben to remember how JS works
  * documentation
